There were some hits for `net`, but they were related to serialization and
not actually opening any connections or anything like that.

There were 2 hits of `unsafe` when grepping:
* In `fn as_str` in `impl Buf`
* In `fn serialize` in `impl Serialize for net::Ipv4Addr`

Unsafe review comments can be found in https://crrev.com/c/5350573/2 (this
review also covered `serde_json_lenient`).

`quote` is a utility crate used by proc-macros to generate TokenStreams
conveniently from source code. The bulk of the logic is some complex

This crate contains no unsafe code, and the internal logic, while difficult to
read, is generally straightforward. I have audited the the quote macros, ident
formatter, and runtime logic.
